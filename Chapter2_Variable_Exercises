Reflection: I'd say the biggest lesson I learned from these exercise is the importance of data types in Python. Most of the errors I ran encountered early on involved me trying to concatenate two different data types.
These struggles weren't in vain however as they helped to reinforce the usefulness of the str(), float(), and int() functions. But despite this epiphany, I did feel like taking user input and then converting it into 
the data type I needed seemed a little convoluted. Is there not a wway to get user input and then convert it into a certain data type all in one step instead of two?
